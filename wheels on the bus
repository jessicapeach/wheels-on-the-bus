the wheels on the bus go round and round,
round and round,
round and round,
the wheels on the bus go round and round,
all around the town 

the driver on the bus says "move on back",
move on back,
"move on back"
the driver on the bus says "move on back",
all around the town

the wipers on the bush go swish swish swish,
swish swish swish,
swish swish swish,
the wipers on the bus go swish swish swish
all around town 

the horn on the bus goes beep beep beep,
beep beep beep, beep beep beep, 
the horn on the bus goes beep beep beep
all around town
